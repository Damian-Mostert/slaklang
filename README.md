# about slaklang 1.1.0

<br>slak lang is curently a view engen for html templates, but soon will have a script compiler

# using a static server
```js
const express = require('express')
const slaklang = require('slaklang')
const app = express()
StaticUrl = "/"
StaticPath = __dirname+"/www"
app.use(StaticUrl,(req,res)=>{slaklang.express.static(StaticUrl,StaticPath,req,res)})
app.listen(8080)
```
once your static server is up, you can start using slak in your www file, all your slak files must end with .slak , they will handle both the GET and POST requests
# using pure JavaScript works in slakLang too :)
```php
<?_@
console.log("all java script things work :)")
_@?>
```
# what is slak lang?
slak lang is a smart hrml render engen allowing you to use java script to build your pages,
it also has built in language features, specified to build html and look simular to html, and some old php features
```php
<DOCTYPE html>
<?_@
@html/
@head/

/{}@_
@body/
for(m=0;m<10;m++){
  echo(<<<EOT
  even echo and eot works !
  EOT>>>)
    console.log(`@ java script works here too ${m}`)
}
/{style="background:#111;color:#fff"}@_
/{}@_

_@?>
<label>HTML WORKS TOO</label>
```
# slak labels santax
most slak labals build html parts, some are built as functions, but are still in development
```php
@html/ /*your html tag like img button body ...*/
//the tags inside
@label/echo("hello")/@_
console.log("label built") // then you can do your scripting here
/{style="color:red",cls="main"}@_ //your css, onclick and stuff like that, only deference is class is now cls
//using css
//unfortunately I couldnâ€™t use style as a tag as it conflicts with your style config in your tag
// so i decided to use @css as a tag
@css/
echo(`
body{
  background:blue
}
`)
/{}@_
//you can always just use the link tag for external css
@link/ /{rel="stylesheet",href="/yourcss.css"}@_
// tail wind css works with .slak files too
```
# latest updates
```php
<?_@
//you can also declare tag options before the tag
style is "color:#fff;background:#111;font-family:arial"
@body/
@label/
echo("Slak lang just got so much better :) ")
/{style is "color:blue"}@_

M is 50 plus 20 with 5// ' plus ' and ' with ' works as +
console.log(M)
